		About Me
	</h1>
	<h2>
		The Basics
	</h2>
	<p>My name is Anthony Lancaster, but I go by Tony. I am a software engineer from the Richmond area. Currently, I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. I am studying to get my B.S. in computer science and I plan to graduate in May 2020.
	</p>
	<h2>
		But who are you really?
	</h2>
	<p>
		That aside, there are all kinds of fun things to know about me. Like anyone I have my passions and my joys and the things that make me quirky old me. I am a strong Christian and love serving others. I have a great love for cats, especially my very own 20 pounder George. I am a roller coaster enthusiast and have logged over 100 different roller coasters ridden, all across the east coast. I am a barista and honestly have an unecessary amount of knowledge about coffee. I like roller skating and have a dream of starting my own roller derby team. I am a musician and own too many instruments, but I keep collecting more.
